# Discord TTS Module

This is a bot (written using discord.py) that allows users chatting in text channels to output their messages to their voice channel.

This project was mainly developed from April 2021-June 2022.

**Note:** This project is different from Discord's built-in TTS, that outputs messages to Discord users' speakers.

## Usage

This module has been tested with Python 3.9 (though very likely would work with newer versions). So, make sure to install Python 3.9+.

Install dependencies with:

```sh
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, start up the bot with

```sh
python3 bot.py
```

Theoretically, you should be able to plop `tts.py` and `helpers/` into a bot and have it work.
